Cisco IOS:

############## set up duplex and speed ############## 
- It is best to set the speed and duplex on distribusion and core networking devices as best practice. Within the access layer (host to switch), auto negotiation is allowed. This is because autonegotiation can sometimes produce unpredicted results and Cisco switches will failover to half-duplex.
    config# interface fa 0/0
    config-if# duplex full
    config-if# speed 100

############## Remove automatic DNS resolve ##############

config# no ip domain-lookup

############## Set terminal history size ##############
- terminal history size is about 10 by default. Use the following command to increase the history.

config# terminal history size ?

############## Set interface IP ##############
- For switches, interfaces do not need an IP address. For other networking devices (routers, firewalls, etc.), they require the IP address be set and the interface turned on.

config# interface g 0/0     // select gigabitEthernet 0/0
config-if# ip address 192.168.1.1
config-if# description gateway interface    // always provide a description
config-if# duplex full
config-if# speed 100
config-if# no shut      // enable the interface. You should see debug info.
